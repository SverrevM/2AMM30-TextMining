       "'Alice OConnor born Alisa Zinovyevna Rosenbaum  1905\\xa0– March 6 1982 better known by her pen name Ayn Rand  was a Russianborn American writer and philosopher She is known for her fiction and for developing a philosophical system she named Objectivism Born and educated in Russia she moved to the United States in 1926 After two early novels that were initially unsuccessful and two Broadway plays she achieved fame with her 1943 novel The Fountainhead In 1957 Rand published her bestknown work the novel Atlas Shrugged Afterward until her death in 1982 she turned to nonfiction to promote her philosophy publishing her own periodicals and releasing several collections of essays\\nRand advocated reason as the only means of acquiring knowledge she rejected faith and religion She supported rational and ethical egoism and rejected altruism In politics she condemned the initiation of force as immoral and opposed collectivism statism and anarchism Instead she supported laissezfaire capitalism which she defined as the system based on recognizing individual rights including private property rights Although Rand opposed libertarianism which she viewed as anarchism she is often associated with the modern libertarian movement in the United States In art Rand promoted romantic realism She was sharply critical of most philosophers and philosophical traditions known to her except for Aristotle Thomas Aquinas and classical liberals\\nRands fiction received mixed reviews from literary critics Although academic interest in her ideas has grown since her death academic philosophers have generally ignored or rejected her philosophy bececause of her polemical approach and lack of methodological rigor Her writings have politically influenced some libertarians and conservatives The Objectivist movement attempts to spread her ideas both to the public and in academic settings\\nLife\\nEarly life\\nRand was born Alisa Zinovyevna Rosenbaum on February\\xa02 1905 to a RussianJewish bourgeois family living in Saint Petersburg She was the eldest of three daughters of Zinovy Zakharovich Rosenbaum a pharmacist and Anna Borisovna  She was twelve when the October Revolution and the rule of the Bolsheviks under Vladimir Lenin disrupted the life the family had enjoyed previously Her fathers business was confiscated and the family fled to the city of Yevpatoria in Crimea which was initially under the control of the White Army during the Russian Civil War After graduating high school there in June 1921 she returned with her family to Petrograd as Saint Petersburg was then named where they faced desperate conditions occasionally nearly starving\\nWhen Russian universities were opened to women after the revolution she was in the first group of women to enroll at Petrograd State University At 16 she began her studies in the department of social pedagogy majoring in history Along with many other bourgeois students she was purged from the university shortly before graduating After complaints from a group of visiting foreign scientists many of the purged students were allowed to complete their work and graduate which she did in October 1924 She then studied for a year at the State Technicum for Screen Arts in Leningrad For an assignment Rand wrote an essay about the Polish actress Pola Negri which became her first published work By this time she had decided her professional surname for writing would be Rand and she adopted the first name Ayn pronounced \\nIn late 1925 Rand was granted a visa to visit relatives in Chicago She departed on January\\xa017 1926 and arrived in New York City on February\\xa019 1926 Intent on staying in the United States to become a screenwriter she lived for a few months with her relatives before leaving for Hollywood California\\nIn Hollywood a chance meeting with famed director Cecil B DeMille led to work as an extra in his film The King of Kings and a subsequent job as a junior screenwriter While working on The King of Kings she met an aspiring young actor  the two married on April\\xa015 1929 She became a permanent American resident in July 1929 and an American citizen on March\\xa03 1931 She made several attempts to bring her parents and sisters to the United States but they were unable to obtain permission to emigrate\\nEarly fiction\\nRands first literary success came with the sale of her screenplay Red Pawn to Universal Studios in 1932 although it was never produced Her courtroom drama Night of January\\xa016th first staged in Hollywood in 1934 reopened successfully on Broadway in 1935 Each night a jury was selected from members of the audience based on its vote one of two different endings would be performed\\nHer first published novel the semiautobiographical We the Living was published in 1936 Set in Soviet Russia it focused on the struggle between the individual and the state Initial sales were slow and the American publisher let it go out of print although European editions continued to sell She adapted the story as a stage play but the Broadway production was a failure and closed in less than a week After the success of her later novels Rand was able to release a revised version in 1959 that has since sold over three million copies\\nRand started her next major novel The Fountainhead in December 1935 but took a break from it in 1937 to write her novella Anthem The novella presents a vision of a dystopian future world in which totalitarian collectivism has triumphed to such an extent that even the word I has been forgotten and replaced with we It was published in England in 1938 but Rand could not find an American publisher at that time As with We the Living Rands later success allowed her to get a revised version published in 1946 which has sold over 35\\xa0million copies\\nThe Fountainhead and political activism\\nDuring the 1940s Rand became politically active She and her husband were fulltime volunteers for Republican Wendell Willkies 1940 presidential campaign This work brought her into contact with other intellectuals sympathetic to freemarket capitalism She became friends with journalist Henry Hazlitt who introduced her to the Austrian School economist Ludwig von Mises Despite philosophical differences with them Rand strongly endorsed the writings of both men throughout her career and they expressed admiration for her Mises once referred to her as the most courageous man in America a compliment that particularly pleased her bececause he said man instead of woman Rand became friends with libertarian writer Isabel Paterson Rand questioned her about American history and politics long into the night during their many meetings and gave Paterson ideas for her only nonfiction book The God of the Machine\\nRands first major success as a writer came in 1943 with The Fountainhead a novel about an uncompromising young architect named Howard Roark and his struggle against what Rand described as secondhanders—those who attempt to live through others placing others above themselves Twelve publishers rejected it before BobbsMerrill Company accepted it at the insistence of editor Archibald Ogden who threatened to quit if his employer did not publish it While completing the novel Rand was prescribed the amphetamine Benzedrine to fight fatigue The drug helped her to work long hours to meet her deadline for delivering the novel but afterwards she was so exhausted that her doctor ordered two weeks rest Her use of the drug for approximately three decades may have contributed to what some of her later associates described as volatile mood swings\\nThe success of The Fountainhead brought Rand fame and financial security In 1943 she sold the film rights to Warner Bros and returned to Hollywood to write the screenplay Producer Hal B Wallis hired her afterwards as a screenwriter and scriptdoctor Her work for him included the screenplays for Love Letters and You Came Along Her contract with Wallis also allowed time for other projects including a nevercompleted nonfiction treatment of her philosophy to be called The Moral Basis of Individualism\\nWhile working in Hollywood Rand became involved with the antiCommunist Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals and wrote articles on the groups behalf She also joined the antiCommunist American Writers Association In 1947 during the Second Red Scare Rand testified as a friendly witness before the United States House UnAmerican Activities Committee that the 1944 film Song of Russia grossly misrepresented conditions in the Soviet Union portraying life there as much better and happier than it was She also wanted to criticize the lauded 1946 film The Best Years of Our Lives for what she interpreted as its negative presentation of the business world but was not allowed to do so When asked after the hearings about her feelings on the investigations effectiveness Rand described the process as futile\\nAfter several delays the film version of The Fountainhead was released in 1949 Although it used Rands screenplay with minimal alterations she disliked the movie from beginning to end and complained about its editing the acting and other elements\\nAtlas Shrugged and Objectivism\\nFollowing the publication of The Fountainhead Rand received many letters from readers some of whom the book had influenced profoundly In 1951 Rand moved from Los Angeles to New York City where she gathered a group of these admirers that included future chair of the Federal Reserve Alan Greenspan a young psychology student named Nathan Blumenthal later Nathaniel Branden and his wife Barbara and Barbaras cousin Leonard Peikoff Initially the group was an informal gathering of friends who met with Rand at her apartment on weekends to discuss philosophy Later Rand began allowing them to read the manuscript drafts of her new novel Atlas Shrugged In 1954 her close relationship with Nathaniel Branden turned into a romantic affair with the knowledge of their spouses\\nPublished in 1957 Atlas Shrugged was considered Rands magnum opus She described the novels theme as the role of the mind in mans existence—and as a corollary the demonstration of a new moral philosophy the morality of rational selfinterest It advocates the core tenets of Rands philosophy of Objectivism and expresses her concept of human achievement The plot involves a dystopian United States in which the most creative industrialists scientists and artists respond to a welfare state government by going on strike and retreating to a hidden valley where they build an independent free economy The novels hero and leader of the strike John Galt describes it as stopping the motor of the world by withdrawing the minds of the individuals contributing most to the nations wealth and achievements The novel contains an exposition of Objectivism in a lengthy monologue delivered by Galt\\nDespite many negative reviews Atlas Shrugged became an international bestseller but the reaction of intellectuals to the novel discouraged and depressed Rand Atlas Shrugged was her last completed work of fiction marking the end of her career as a novelist and the beginning of her role as a popular philosopher\\nIn 1958 Nathaniel Branden established the Nathaniel Branden Lectures later incorporated as the Nathaniel Branden Institute NBI to promote Rands philosophy through public lectures He and Rand cofounded The Objectivist Newsletter later renamed The Objectivist in 1962 to circulate articles about her ideas she later republished some of these articles in book form Rand was unimpressed by many of the NBI students and held them to strict standards sometimes reacting coldly or angrily to those who disagreed with her Critics including some former NBI students and Branden himself later described the culture of the NBI as one of intellectual conformity and excessive reverence for Rand Some described the NBI or the Objectivist movement as a cult or religion Rand expressed opinions on a wide range of topics from literature and music to sexuality and facial hair Some of her followers mimicked her preferences wearing clothes to match characters from her novels and buying furniture like hers However some former NBI students believed the extent of these behaviors was exaggerated and the problem was concentrated among Rands closest followers in New York\\nLater years\\nThroughout the 1960s and 1970s Rand developed and promoted her Objectivist philosophy through her nonfiction works and by giving talks to students at colleges and universities She began delivering annual lectures at the Ford Hall Forum responding to questions from the audience During these appearances she often took controversial stances on the political and social issues of the day These included supporting abortion rights opposing the Vietnam War and the military draft but condemning many draft dodgers as bums supporting Israel in the Yom Kippur War of 1973 against a coalition of Arab nations as civilized men fighting savages saying European colonists had the right to invade and take land inhabited by American Indians and calling homosexuality immoral and disgusting while also advocating the repeal of all laws concerning it She endorsed several Republican candidates for president of the United States most strongly Barry Goldwater in 1964 whose candidacy she promoted in several articles for The Objectivist Newsletter\\nIn 1964 Nathaniel Branden began an affair with the young actress Patrecia Scott whom he later married Nathaniel and Barbara Branden kept the affair hidden from Rand When she learned of it in 1968 though her romantic relationship with Branden had already ended Rand ended her relationship with both Brandens and the NBI was closed She published an article in The Objectivist repudiating Nathaniel Branden for dishonesty and other irrational behavior in his private life In subsequent years Rand and several more of her closest associates parted company\\nRand underwent surgery for lung cancer in 1974 after decades of heavy smoking In 1976 she retired from writing her newsletter and after her initial objections allowed a social worker employed by her attorney to enroll her in Social Security and Medicare During the late 1970s her activities within the Objectivist movement declined especially after the death of her husband on November\\xa09 1979 One of her final projects was work on a nevercompleted television adaptation of Atlas Shrugged\\nOn March\\xa06 1982 Rand died of heart failure at her home in New York City At her funeral a floral arrangement in the shape of a dollar sign was placed near her casket In her will Rand named Peikoff as her heir\\nLiterary method and influences\\nRand described her approach to literature as romantic realism She wanted her fiction to present the world as it could be and should be rather than as it was This approach led her to create highly stylized situations and characters Her fiction typically has protagonists who are heroic individualists depicted as fit and attractive Her villains support duty and collectivist moral ideals Rand often describes them as unattractive and some have names that suggest negative traits such as Wesley Mouch in Atlas Shrugged\\nRand considered plot a critical element of literature and her stories typically have what biographer Anne Heller described as tight elaborate fastpaced plotting Romantic triangles are a common plot element in Rands fiction in most of her novels and plays the main female character is romantically involved with at least two different men\\nInfluences\\nIn school Rand read works by Fyodor Dostoevsky Victor Hugo Edmond Rostand and Friedrich Schiller who became her favorites She considered them to be among the top rank of Romantic writers bececause of their focus on moral themes and their skill at constructing plots Hugo was an important influence on her writing especially her approach to plotting In the introduction she wrote for an Englishlanguage edition of his novel NinetyThree Rand called him the greatest novelist in world literature\\nAlthough Rand disliked most Russian literature her depictions of her heroes show the influence of the Russian Symbolists and other nineteenthcentury Russian writing most notably the 1863 novel What Is to Be Done by Nikolay Chernyshevsky Rands experience of the Russian Revolution and early Communist Russia influenced the portrayal of her villains Beyond We the Living which is set in Russia this influence can be seen in the ideas and rhetoric of Ellsworth Toohey in The Fountainhead and in the destruction of the economy in Atlas Shrugged\\nRands descriptive style echoes her early career writing scenarios and scripts for movies her novels have many narrative descriptions that resemble early Hollywood movie scenarios They often follow common film editing conventions such as having a broad establishing shot description of a scene followed by closeup details and her descriptions of women characters often take a male gaze perspective\\nPhilosophy\\nRand called her philosophy Objectivism describing its essence as the concept of man as a heroic being with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life with productive achievement as his noblest activity and reason as his only absolute She considered Objectivism a systematic philosophy and laid out positions on metaphysics epistemology ethics political philosophy and aesthetics\\nIn metaphysics Rand supported philosophical realism and opposed anything she regarded as mysticism or supernaturalism including all forms of religion Rand believed in free will as a form of agent causation and rejected determinism\\nIn epistemology Rand considered all knowledge to be based on sense perception the validity of which she considered axiomatic and reason which she described as the faculty that identifies and integrates the material provided by mans senses Rand rejected all claims of nonperceptual knowledge including instinct intuition revelation or any form of just knowing In her Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology Rand presented a theory of concept formation and rejected the analytic–synthetic dichotomy She believed epistemology was a foundational branch of philosophy and considered the advocacy of reason to be the single most significant aspect of her philosophy\\nIn ethics Rand argued for rational and ethical egoism rational selfinterest as the guiding moral principle She said the individual should exist for his own sake neither sacrificing himself to others nor sacrificing others to himself Rand referred to egoism as the virtue of selfishness in her book of that title In it she presented her solution to the is–ought problem by describing a metaethical theory that based morality in the needs of mans survival qua man She condemned ethical altruism as incompatible with the requirements of human life and happiness and held the initiation of force was evil and irrational writing in Atlas Shrugged that Force and mind are opposites\\nRands political philosophy emphasized individual rights including property rights She considered laissezfaire capitalism the only moral social system bececause in her view it was the only system based on protecting those rights Rand opposed collectivism and statism which she understood to include many specific forms of government such as communism fascism socialism theocracy and the welfare state Her preferred form of government was a constitutional republic that is limited to the protection of individual rights Although her political views are often classified as conservative or libertarian Rand preferred the term radical for capitalism She worked with conservatives on political projects but disagreed with them over issues such as religion and ethics Rand denounced libertarianism which she associated with anarchism She rejected anarchism as a naive theory based in subjectivism that would lead to collectivism in practice\\nIn aesthetics Rand defined art as a selective recreation of reality according to an artists metaphysical valuejudgments According to her art allows philosophical concepts to be presented in a concrete form that can be grasped easily thereby fulfilling a need of human consciousness As a writer the art form Rand focused on most closely was literature She considered romanticism to be the approach that most accurately reflected the existence of human free will\\nCriticisms\\nRands ethics and politics are the most criticized areas of her philosophy Numerous authors including Robert Nozick and William F ONeill in some of the earliest academic critiques of her ideas said she failed in her attempt to solve the is–ought problem Critics have called her definitions of egoism and altruism biased and inconsistent with normal usage Critics from religious traditions oppose her atheism and her rejection of altruism\\nMultiple critics including Nozick have said her attempt to justify individual rights based on egoism fails Others like libertarian philosopher Michael Huemer have gone further saying that her support of egoism and her support of individual rights are inconsistent positions Some critics like Roy Childs have said that her opposition to the initiation of force should lead to support of anarchism rather than limited government\\nCommentators including Hazel Barnes Albert Ellis and Nathaniel Branden have criticized Rands focus on the importance of reason Branden said this emphasis led her to denigrate emotions and create unrealistic expectations of how consistently rational human beings should be\\nRelationship to other philosophers\\nExcept for Aristotle Thomas Aquinas and classical liberals Rand was sharply critical of most philosophers and philosophical traditions known to her Acknowledging Aristotle as her greatest influence Rand remarked that in the history of philosophy she could only recommend three As—Aristotle Aquinas and Ayn Rand In a 1959 interview with Mike Wallace when asked where her philosophy came from she responded Out of my own mind with the sole acknowledgement of a debt to Aristotle the only philosopher who ever influenced me\\nIn an article for the Claremont Review of Books political scientist Charles Murray criticized her claim that her only philosophical debt was to Aristotle He asserted her ideas were derivative of previous thinkers such as John Locke and Friedrich Nietzsche Rand found early inspiration from Nietzsche and scholars have found indications of this in Rands private journals In 1928 she alluded to his idea of the superman in notes for an unwritten novel whose protagonist was inspired by the murderer William Edward Hickman There are other indications of Nietzsche is influence in passages from the first edition of We the Living which Rand later revised and in her overall writing style By the time she wrote The Fountainhead Rand had turned against Nietzsche is ideas and the extent of his influence on her even during her early years is disputed\\nRand considered her philosophical opposite to be Immanuel Kant whom she referred to as the most evil man in mankinds history she believed his epistemology undermined reason and his ethics opposed selfinterest Philosophers George Walsh and Fred Seddon have argued she misinterpreted Kant and exaggerated their differences She was also critical of Plato and viewed his differences with Aristotle on questions of metaphysics and epistemology as the primary conflict in the history of philosophy\\nRands relationship with contemporary philosophers was mostly antagonistic She was not an academic and did not participate in academic discourse She was dismissive toward critics and wrote about ideas she disagreed with in a polemical manner without indepth analysis She was in turn viewed very negatively by many academic philosophers who dismissed her as an unimportant figure who need not be given serious consideration\\nReception and legacy\\nCritical reception\\nThe first reviews Rand received were for Night of January 16th Reviews of the Broadway production were largely positive but Rand considered even positive reviews to be embarrassing bececause of significant changes made to her script by the producer Although Rand believed that her novel We the Living was not widely reviewed over 200 publications published approximately 125 different reviews Overall they were more positive than those she received for her later work Her novella Anthem received little review attention both for its first publication in England and for subsequent reissues\\nRands first bestseller The Fountainhead received far fewer reviews than We the Living and reviewers opinions were mixed Lorine Pruettes positive review in The New York Times which called the author a writer of great power who wrote brilliantly beautifully and bitterly was one that Rand greatly appreciated There were other positive reviews but Rand dismissed most of them for either misunderstanding her message or for being in unimportant publications Some negative reviews said the novel was too long others called the characters unsympathetic and Rands style offensively pedestrian\\nAtlas Shrugged was widely reviewed and many of the reviews were strongly negative Atlas Shrugged received positive reviews from a few publications but Rand scholar Mimi Reisel Gladstein later wrote that reviewers seemed to vie with each other in a contest to devise the cleverest putdowns with reviews including comments that it was written out of hate and showed remorseless hectoring and prolixity Whittaker Chambers wrote what was later called the novels most notorious review for the conservative magazine National Review He accused Rand of supporting a godless system which he related to that of the Soviets claiming From almost any page of Atlas Shrugged a voice can be heard  commanding To a gas chamber—go\\nRands nonfiction received far fewer reviews than her novels The tenor of the criticism for her first nonfiction book For the New Intellectual was similar to that for Atlas Shrugged Philosopher Sidney Hook likened her certainty to the way philosophy is written in the Soviet Union and author Gore Vidal called her viewpoint nearly perfect in its immorality These reviews set the pattern for reaction to her ideas among liberal critics Her subsequent books got progressively less review attention\\nPopular interest\\nWith over 30\\xa0million copies sold  Rands books continue to be read widely A survey conducted for the Library of Congress and the BookoftheMonth Club in 1991 asked club members to name the most influential book in their lives Rands Atlas Shrugged was the second most popular choice after the Bible Although Rands influence has been greatest in the United States there has been international interest in her work\\nRands contemporary admirers included fellow novelists like Ira Levin Kay Nolte Smith and L Neil Smith she has influenced later writers like Erika Holzer Terry Goodkind and comic book artist Steve Ditko Rand provided a positive view of business and subsequently many business executives and entrepreneurs have admired and promoted her work Businessmen such as John Allison of BBT and Ed Snider of Comcast Spectacor have funded the promotion of Rands ideas\\nTelevision shows movies and video games have referred to Rand and her works Throughout her life she was the subject of many articles in popular magazines as well as booklength critiques by authors such as the psychologist Albert Ellis and Trinity Foundation president John W Robbins Rand or characters based on her figure prominently in novels by American authors including Mary Gaitskill Matt Ruff Kay Nolte Smith and Tobias Wolff Nick Gillespie former editorinchief of Reason remarked that Rands is a tortured immortality one in which she is as likely to be a punch line as a protagonist Jibes at Rand as cold and inhuman run through the popular culture Two movies have been made about Rands life A 1997 documentary film  was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature The Passion of Ayn Rand a 1999 television adaptation of the book of the same name won several awards Rands image also appears on a 1999 US postage stamp illustrated by artist Nick Gaetano\\nRands works most commonly Anthem or The Fountainhead are sometimes assigned as secondary school reading Since 2002 the Ayn Rand Institute has provided free copies of Rands novels to teachers who promise to include the books in their curriculum The Institute had distributed 45\\xa0million copies in the US and Canada by the end of 2020 In 2017 Rand was added to the required reading list for the A Level Politics exam in the United Kingdom\\nPolitical influence\\nAlthough she rejected the labels conservative and libertarian Rand has had a continuing influence on rightwing politics and libertarianism Rand is often considered one of the three most important women along with Rose Wilder Lane and Isabel Paterson in the early development of modern American libertarianism David Nolan one founder of the Libertarian Party said that without Ayn Rand the libertarian movement would not exist In his history of that movement journalist Brian Doherty described her as the most influential libertarian of the twentieth century to the public at large Historian Jennifer Burns referred to her as the ultimate gateway drug to life on the right\\nThe political figures who cite Rand as an influence are usually conservatives often members of the Republican Party despite Rand taking some atypical positions for a conservative like being prochoice and an atheist She faced intense opposition from William F Buckley Jr and other contributors to the conservative National Review magazine which published numerous criticisms of her writings and ideas Nevertheless a 1987 article in The New York Times referred to her as the Reagan administrations novelist laureate Republican congressmen and conservative pundits have acknowledged her influence on their lives and have recommended her novels She has influenced some conservative politicians outside the US such as Sajid Javid in the United Kingdom Siv Jensen in Norway and Ayelet Shaked in Israel\\nThe financial crisis of 2007–2008 spurred renewed interest in her works especially Atlas Shrugged which some saw as foreshadowing the crisis Opinion articles compared realworld events with the novels plot Signs mentioning Rand and her fictional hero John Galt appeared at Tea Party protests There was increased criticism of her ideas especially from the political left Critics blamed the economic crisis on her support of selfishness and free markets particularly through her influence on Alan Greenspan In 2015 Adam Weiner said that through Greenspan Rand had effectively chucked a ticking time bomb into the boiler room of the US economy Lisa Duggan said that Rands novels had incalculable impact in encouraging the spread of neoliberal political ideas In 2021 Cass Sunstein said Rands ideas could be seen in the tax and regulatory policies of the Trump administration which he attributed to the enduring influence of Rands fiction\\nAcademic reaction\\nDuring Rands lifetime her work received little attention from academic scholars Since her death interest in her work has increased gradually In 2009 historian Jennifer Burns identified three overlapping waves of scholarly interest in Rand including an explosion of scholarship since 2000 As of that year few universities included Rand or Objectivism as a philosophical specialty or research area with many literature and philosophy departments dismissing her as a pop culture phenomenon rather than a subject for serious study From 2002 to 2012 over 60 colleges and universities accepted grants from the charitable foundation of BBT Corporation that required teaching Rands ideas or works in some cases the grants were controversial or even rejected bececause of the requirement to teach about Rand In 2020 media critic Eric Burns said that Rand is surely the most engaging philosopher of my lifetime but nobody in the academe pays any attention to her neither as an author nor a philosopher That same year the editor of a collection of critical essays about Rand said academics who disapproved of her ideas had long held a stubborn resolve to ignore or ridicule her work but he believed more academic critics were engaging with her work in recent years\\nTo her ideas\\nIn 1967 John Hospers discussed Rands ethical ideas in the second edition of his textbook An Introduction to Philosophical Analysis That same year Hazel Barnes included a chapter critiquing Objectivism in her book An Existentialist Ethics When the first fulllength academic book about Rands philosophy appeared in 1971 its author declared writing about Rand a treacherous undertaking that could lead to guilt by association for taking her seriously A few articles about Rands ideas appeared in academic journals before her death in 1982 many of them in The Personalist One of these was On the Randian Argument by libertarian philosopher Robert Nozick who criticized her metaethical arguments Other philosophers writing in the same publication argued that Nozick misstated Rands case In an article responding to Nozick Douglas Den Uyl and Douglas B Rasmussen defended her positions but described her style as literary hyperbolic and emotional\\nThe Philosophic Thought of Ayn Rand a 1984 collection of essays about Objectivism edited by Den Uyl and Rasmussen was the first academic book about Rands ideas published after her death In one essay political writer Jack Wheeler wrote that despite the incessant bombast and continuous venting of Randian rage Rands ethics are a most immense achievement the study of which is vastly more fruitful than any other in contemporary thought In 1987 the Ayn Rand Society was founded as an affiliate of the American Philosophical Association\\nIn a 1995 entry about Rand in Contemporary Women Philosophers Jenny A Heyl described a divergence in how different academic specialties viewed Rand She said that Rands philosophy is regularly omitted from academic philosophy Yet throughout literary academia Ayn Rand is considered a philosopher Writing in the 1998 edition of the Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy political theorist Chandran Kukathas summarized the mainstream philosophical reception of her work in two parts He said most commentators view her ethical argument as an unconvincing variant of Aristotles ethics and her political theory is of little interest bececause it is marred by an illthought out and unsystematic effort to reconcile her hostility to the state with her rejection of anarchism The Journal of Ayn Rand Studies a multidisciplinary peerreviewed academic journal devoted to the study of Rand and her ideas was established in 1999\\nIn a 2010 essay for the Cato Institute Huemer argued very few people find Rands ideas convincing especially her ethics He attributed the attention she receives to her being a compelling writer especially as a novelist noting that Atlas Shrugged outsells Rands nonfiction works and the works of other philosophers of classical liberalism In 2012 the Pennsylvania State University Press agreed to take over publication of The Journal of Ayn Rand Studies and the University of Pittsburgh Press launched an Ayn Rand Society Philosophical Studies series based on the Societys proceedings The Fall 2012 update to the entry about Rand in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy said that only a few professional philosophers have taken her work seriously That same year political scientist Alan Wolfe dismissed Rand as a nonperson among academics an attitude that writer Ben Murnane later described as the traditional academic view of Rand\\nTo her fiction\\nAcademic consideration of Rand as a literary figure during her life was even more limited than the discussion of her philosophy Mimi Reisel Gladstein could not find any scholarly articles about Rands novels when she began researching her in 1973 and only three such articles appeared during the rest of the 1970s Since her death scholars of English and American literature have continued largely to ignore her work although attention to her literary work has increased since the 1990s Several academic book series about important authors cover Rand and her works as do popular study guides like CliffsNotes and SparkNotes In The Literary Encyclopedia entry for Rand written in 2001 John David Lewis declared that Rand wrote the most intellectually challenging fiction of her generation In 2019 Duggan described Rands fiction as popular and influential on many readers despite being easy to criticize for her cartoonish characters and melodramatic plots her rigid moralizing her middle to lowbrow aesthetic preferences\\xa0 and philosophical strivings\\nObjectivist movement\\nAfter the closure of the Nathaniel Branden Institute the Objectivist movement continued in other forms In the 1970s Peikoff began delivering courses on Objectivism In 1979 Peter Schwartz started a newsletter called The Intellectual Activist which Rand endorsed She also endorsed The Objectivist Forum a bimonthly magazine founded by Objectivist philosopher Harry Binswanger which ran from 1980 to 1987\\nIn 1985 Peikoff worked with businessman Ed Snider to establish the Ayn Rand Institute a nonprofit organization dedicated to promoting Rands ideas and works In 1990 after an ideological disagreement with Peikoff David Kelley founded the Institute for Objectivist Studies now known as The Atlas Society In 2001 historian John McCaskey organized the Anthem Foundation for Objectivist Scholarship which provides grants for scholarly work on Objectivism in academia\\nSelected works\\nFiction and drama\\nNonfiction'"

       "'Alice OConnor born Alisa Zinovyevna Rosenbaum  1905\\xa0– March 6 1982 better known by her pen name Ayn Rand  was a Russianborn American writer and philosopher She is known for her fiction and for developing a philosophical system she named Objectivism Born and educated in Russia she moved to the United States in 1926 After two early novels that were initially unsuccessful and two Broadway plays she achieved fame with her 1943 novel The Fountainhead In 1957 Rand published her bestknown work the novel Atlas Shrugged Afterward until her death in 1982 she turned to nonfiction to promote her philosophy publishing her own periodicals and releasing several collections of essays\\nRand advocated reason as the only means of acquiring knowledge she rejected faith and religion She supported rational and ethical egoism and rejected altruism In politics she condemned the initiation of force as immoral and opposed collectivism statism and anarchism Instead she supported laissezfaire capitalism which she defined as the system based on recognizing individual rights including private property rights Although Rand opposed libertarianism which she viewed as anarchism she is often associated with the modern libertarian movement in the United States In art Rand promoted romantic realism She was sharply critical of most philosophers and philosophical traditions known to her except for Aristotle Thomas Aquinas and classical liberals\\nRands fiction received mixed reviews from literary critics Although academic interest in her ideas has grown since her death academic philosophers have generally ignored or rejected her philosophy bececause of her polemical approach and lack of methodological rigor Her writings have politically influenced some libertarians and conservatives The Objectivist movement attempts to spread her ideas both to the public and in academic settings\\nLife\\nEarly life\\nRand was born Alisa Zinovyevna Rosenbaum on February\\xa02 1905 to a RussianJewish bourgeois family living in Saint Petersburg She was the eldest of three daughters of Zinovy Zakharovich Rosenbaum a pharmacist and Anna Borisovna  She was twelve when the October Revolution and the rule of the Bolsheviks under Vladimir Lenin disrupted the life the family had enjoyed previously Her fathers business was confiscated and the family fled to the city of Yevpatoria in Crimea which was initially under the control of the White Army during the Russian Civil War After graduating high school there in June 1921 she returned with her family to Petrograd as Saint Petersburg was then named where they faced desperate conditions occasionally nearly starving\\nWhen Russian universities were opened to women after the revolution she was in the first group of women to enroll at Petrograd State University At 16 she began her studies in the department of social pedagogy majoring in history Along with many other bourgeois students she was purged from the university shortly before graduating After complaints from a group of visiting foreign scientists many of the purged students were allowed to complete their work and graduate which she did in October 1924 She then studied for a year at the State Technicum for Screen Arts in Leningrad For an assignment Rand wrote an essay about the Polish actress Pola Negri which became her first published work By this time she had decided her professional surname for writing would be Rand and she adopted the first name Ayn pronounced \\nIn late 1925 Rand was granted a visa to visit relatives in Chicago She departed on January\\xa017 1926 and arrived in New York City on February\\xa019 1926 Intent on staying in the United States to become a screenwriter she lived for a few months with her relatives before leaving for Hollywood California\\nIn Hollywood a chance meeting with famed director Cecil B DeMille led to work as an extra in his film The King of Kings and a subsequent job as a junior screenwriter While working on The King of Kings she met an aspiring young actor  the two married on April\\xa015 1929 She became a permanent American resident in July 1929 and an American citizen on March\\xa03 1931 She made several attempts to bring her parents and sisters to the United States but they were unable to obtain permission to emigrate\\nEarly fiction\\nRands first literary success came with the sale of her screenplay Red Pawn to Universal Studios in 1932 although it was never produced Her courtroom drama Night of January\\xa016th first staged in Hollywood in 1934 reopened successfully on Broadway in 1935 Each night a jury was selected from members of the audience based on its vote one of two different endings would be performed\\nHer first published novel the semiautobiographical We the Living was published in 1936 Set in Soviet Russia it focused on the struggle between the individual and the state Initial sales were slow and the American publisher let it go out of print although European editions continued to sell She adapted the story as a stage play but the Broadway production was a failure and closed in less than a week After the success of her later novels Rand was able to release a revised version in 1959 that has since sold over three million copies\\nRand started her next major novel The Fountainhead in December 1935 but took a break from it in 1937 to write her novella Anthem The novella presents a vision of a dystopian future world in which totalitarian collectivism has triumphed to such an extent that even the word I has been forgotten and replaced with we It was published in England in 1938 but Rand could not find an American publisher at that time As with We the Living Rands later success allowed her to get a revised version published in 1946 which has sold over 35\\xa0million copies\\nThe Fountainhead and political activism\\nDuring the 1940s Rand became politically active She and her husband were fulltime volunteers for Republican Wendell Willkies 1940 presidential campaign This work brought her into contact with other intellectuals sympathetic to freemarket capitalism She became friends with journalist Henry Hazlitt who introduced her to the Austrian School economist Ludwig von Mises Despite philosophical differences with them Rand strongly endorsed the writings of both men throughout her career and they expressed admiration for her Mises once referred to her as the most courageous man in America a compliment that particularly pleased her bececause he said man instead of woman Rand became friends with libertarian writer Isabel Paterson Rand questioned her about American history and politics long into the night during their many meetings and gave Paterson ideas for her only nonfiction book The God of the Machine\\nRands first major success as a writer came in 1943 with The Fountainhead a novel about an uncompromising young architect named Howard Roark and his struggle against what Rand described as secondhanders—those who attempt to live through others placing others above themselves Twelve publishers rejected it before BobbsMerrill Company accepted it at the insistence of editor Archibald Ogden who threatened to quit if his employer did not publish it While completing the novel Rand was prescribed the amphetamine Benzedrine to fight fatigue The drug helped her to work long hours to meet her deadline for delivering the novel but afterwards she was so exhausted that her doctor ordered two weeks rest Her use of the drug for approximately three decades may have contributed to what some of her later associates described as volatile mood swings\\nThe success of The Fountainhead brought Rand fame and financial security In 1943 she sold the film rights to Warner Bros and returned to Hollywood to write the screenplay Producer Hal B Wallis hired her afterwards as a screenwriter and scriptdoctor Her work for him included the screenplays for Love Letters and You Came Along Her contract with Wallis also allowed time for other projects including a nevercompleted nonfiction treatment of her philosophy to be called The Moral Basis of Individualism\\nWhile working in Hollywood Rand became involved with the antiCommunist Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals and wrote articles on the groups behalf She also joined the antiCommunist American Writers Association In 1947 during the Second Red Scare Rand testified as a friendly witness before the United States House UnAmerican Activities Committee that the 1944 film Song of Russia grossly misrepresented conditions in the Soviet Union portraying life there as much better and happier than it was She also wanted to criticize the lauded 1946 film The Best Years of Our Lives for what she interpreted as its negative presentation of the business world but was not allowed to do so When asked after the hearings about her feelings on the investigations effectiveness Rand described the process as futile\\nAfter several delays the film version of The Fountainhead was released in 1949 Although it used Rands screenplay with minimal alterations she disliked the movie from beginning to end and complained about its editing the acting and other elements\\nAtlas Shrugged and Objectivism\\nFollowing the publication of The Fountainhead Rand received many letters from readers some of whom the book had influenced profoundly In 1951 Rand moved from Los Angeles to New York City where she gathered a group of these admirers that included future chair of the Federal Reserve Alan Greenspan a young psychology student named Nathan Blumenthal later Nathaniel Branden and his wife Barbara and Barbaras cousin Leonard Peikoff Initially the group was an informal gathering of friends who met with Rand at her apartment on weekends to discuss philosophy Later Rand began allowing them to read the manuscript drafts of her new novel Atlas Shrugged In 1954 her close relationship with Nathaniel Branden turned into a romantic affair with the knowledge of their spouses\\nPublished in 1957 Atlas Shrugged was considered Rands magnum opus She described the novels theme as the role of the mind in mans existence—and as a corollary the demonstration of a new moral philosophy the morality of rational selfinterest It advocates the core tenets of Rands philosophy of Objectivism and expresses her concept of human achievement The plot involves a dystopian United States in which the most creative industrialists scientists and artists respond to a welfare state government by going on strike and retreating to a hidden valley where they build an independent free economy The novels hero and leader of the strike John Galt describes it as stopping the motor of the world by withdrawing the minds of the individuals contributing most to the nations wealth and achievements The novel contains an exposition of Objectivism in a lengthy monologue delivered by Galt\\nDespite many negative reviews Atlas Shrugged became an international bestseller but the reaction of intellectuals to the novel discouraged and depressed Rand Atlas Shrugged was her last completed work of fiction marking the end of her career as a novelist and the beginning of her role as a popular philosopher\\nIn 1958 Nathaniel Branden established the Nathaniel Branden Lectures later incorporated as the Nathaniel Branden Institute NBI to promote Rands philosophy through public lectures He and Rand cofounded The Objectivist Newsletter later renamed The Objectivist in 1962 to circulate articles about her ideas she later republished some of these articles in book form Rand was unimpressed by many of the NBI students and held them to strict standards sometimes reacting coldly or angrily to those who disagreed with her Critics including some former NBI students and Branden himself later described the culture of the NBI as one of intellectual conformity and excessive reverence for Rand Some described the NBI or the Objectivist movement as a cult or religion Rand expressed opinions on a wide range of topics from literature and music to sexuality and facial hair Some of her followers mimicked her preferences wearing clothes to match characters from her novels and buying furniture like hers However some former NBI students believed the extent of these behaviors was exaggerated and the problem was concentrated among Rands closest followers in New York\\nLater years\\nThroughout the 1960s and 1970s Rand developed and promoted her Objectivist philosophy through her nonfiction works and by giving talks to students at colleges and universities She began delivering annual lectures at the Ford Hall Forum responding to questions from the audience During these appearances she often took controversial stances on the political and social issues of the day These included supporting abortion rights opposing the Vietnam War and the military draft but condemning many draft dodgers as bums supporting Israel in the Yom Kippur War of 1973 against a coalition of Arab nations as civilized men fighting savages saying European colonists had the right to invade and take land inhabited by American Indians and calling homosexuality immoral and disgusting while also advocating the repeal of all laws concerning it She endorsed several Republican candidates for president of the United States most strongly Barry Goldwater in 1964 whose candidacy she promoted in several articles for The Objectivist Newsletter\\nIn 1964 Nathaniel Branden began an affair with the young actress Patrecia Scott whom he later married Nathaniel and Barbara Branden kept the affair hidden from Rand When she learned of it in 1968 though her romantic relationship with Branden had already ended Rand ended her relationship with both Brandens and the NBI was closed She published an article in The Objectivist repudiating Nathaniel Branden for dishonesty and other irrational behavior in his private life In subsequent years Rand and several more of her closest associates parted company\\nRand underwent surgery for lung cancer in 1974 after decades of heavy smoking In 1976 she retired from writing her newsletter and after her initial objections allowed a social worker employed by her attorney to enroll her in Social Security and Medicare During the late 1970s her activities within the Objectivist movement declined especially after the death of her husband on November\\xa09 1979 One of her final projects was work on a nevercompleted television adaptation of Atlas Shrugged\\nOn March\\xa06 1982 Rand died of heart failure at her home in New York City At her funeral a floral arrangement in the shape of a dollar sign was placed near her casket In her will Rand named Peikoff as her heir\\nLiterary method and influences\\nRand described her approach to literature as romantic realism She wanted her fiction to present the world as it could be and should be rather than as it was This approach led her to create highly stylized situations and characters Her fiction typically has protagonists who are heroic individualists depicted as fit and attractive Her villains support duty and collectivist moral ideals Rand often describes them as unattractive and some have names that suggest negative traits such as Wesley Mouch in Atlas Shrugged\\nRand considered plot a critical element of literature and her stories typically have what biographer Anne Heller described as tight elaborate fastpaced plotting Romantic triangles are a common plot element in Rands fiction in most of her novels and plays the main female character is romantically involved with at least two different men\\nInfluences\\nIn school Rand read works by Fyodor Dostoevsky Victor Hugo Edmond Rostand and Friedrich Schiller who became her favorites She considered them to be among the top rank of Romantic writers bececause of their focus on moral themes and their skill at constructing plots Hugo was an important influence on her writing especially her approach to plotting In the introduction she wrote for an Englishlanguage edition of his novel NinetyThree Rand called him the greatest novelist in world literature\\nAlthough Rand disliked most Russian literature her depictions of her heroes show the influence of the Russian Symbolists and other nineteenthcentury Russian writing most notably the 1863 novel What Is to Be Done by Nikolay Chernyshevsky Rands experience of the Russian Revolution and early Communist Russia influenced the portrayal of her villains Beyond We the Living which is set in Russia this influence can be seen in the ideas and rhetoric of Ellsworth Toohey in The Fountainhead and in the destruction of the economy in Atlas Shrugged\\nRands descriptive style echoes her early career writing scenarios and scripts for movies her novels have many narrative descriptions that resemble early Hollywood movie scenarios They often follow common film editing conventions such as having a broad establishing shot description of a scene followed by closeup details and her descriptions of women characters often take a male gaze perspective\\nPhilosophy\\nRand called her philosophy Objectivism describing its essence as the concept of man as a heroic being with his own happiness as the moral purpose of his life with productive achievement as his noblest activity and reason as his only absolute She considered Objectivism a systematic philosophy and laid out positions on metaphysics epistemology ethics political philosophy and aesthetics\\nIn metaphysics Rand supported philosophical realism and opposed anything she regarded as mysticism or supernaturalism including all forms of religion Rand believed in free will as a form of agent causation and rejected determinism\\nIn epistemology Rand considered all knowledge to be based on sense perception the validity of which she considered axiomatic and reason which she described as the faculty that identifies and integrates the material provided by mans senses Rand rejected all claims of nonperceptual knowledge including instinct intuition revelation or any form of just knowing In her Introduction to Objectivist Epistemology Rand presented a theory of concept formation and rejected the analytic–synthetic dichotomy She believed epistemology was a foundational branch of philosophy and considered the advocacy of reason to be the single most significant aspect of her philosophy\\nIn ethics Rand argued for rational and ethical egoism rational selfinterest as the guiding moral principle She said the individual should exist for his own sake neither sacrificing himself to others nor sacrificing others to himself Rand referred to egoism as the virtue of selfishness in her book of that title In it she presented her solution to the is–ought problem by describing a metaethical theory that based morality in the needs of mans survival qua man She condemned ethical altruism as incompatible with the requirements of human life and happiness and held the initiation of force was evil and irrational writing in Atlas Shrugged that Force and mind are opposites\\nRands political philosophy emphasized individual rights including property rights She considered laissezfaire capitalism the only moral social system bececause in her view it was the only system based on protecting those rights Rand opposed collectivism and statism which she understood to include many specific forms of government such as communism fascism socialism theocracy and the welfare state Her preferred form of government was a constitutional republic that is limited to the protection of individual rights Although her political views are often classified as conservative or libertarian Rand preferred the term radical for capitalism She worked with conservatives on political projects but disagreed with them over issues such as religion and ethics Rand denounced libertarianism which she associated with anarchism She rejected anarchism as a naive theory based in subjectivism that would lead to collectivism in practice\\nIn aesthetics Rand defined art as a selective recreation of reality according to an artists metaphysical valuejudgments According to her art allows philosophical concepts to be presented in a concrete form that can be grasped easily thereby fulfilling a need of human consciousness As a writer the art form Rand focused on most closely was literature She considered romanticism to be the approach that most accurately reflected the existence of human free will\\nCriticisms\\nRands ethics and politics are the most criticized areas of her philosophy Numerous authors including Robert Nozick and William F ONeill in some of the earliest academic critiques of her ideas said she failed in her attempt to solve the is–ought problem Critics have called her definitions of egoism and altruism biased and inconsistent with normal usage Critics from religious traditions oppose her atheism and her rejection of altruism\\nMultiple critics including Nozick have said her attempt to justify individual rights based on egoism fails Others like libertarian philosopher Michael Huemer have gone further saying that her support of egoism and her support of individual rights are inconsistent positions Some critics like Roy Childs have said that her opposition to the initiation of force should lead to support of anarchism rather than limited government\\nCommentators including Hazel Barnes Albert Ellis and Nathaniel Branden have criticized Rands focus on the importance of reason Branden said this emphasis led her to denigrate emotions and create unrealistic expectations of how consistently rational human beings should be\\nRelationship to other philosophers\\nExcept for Aristotle Thomas Aquinas and classical liberals Rand was sharply critical of most philosophers and philosophical traditions known to her Acknowledging Aristotle as her greatest influence Rand remarked that in the history of philosophy she could only recommend three As—Aristotle Aquinas and Ayn Rand In a 1959 interview with Mike Wallace when asked where her philosophy came from she responded Out of my own mind with the sole acknowledgement of a debt to Aristotle the only philosopher who ever influenced me\\nIn an article for the Claremont Review of Books political scientist Charles Murray criticized her claim that her only philosophical debt was to Aristotle He asserted her ideas were derivative of previous thinkers such as John Locke and Friedrich Nietzsche Rand found early inspiration from Nietzsche and scholars have found indications of this in Rands private journals In 1928 she alluded to his idea of the superman in notes for an unwritten novel whose protagonist was inspired by the murderer William Edward Hickman There are other indications of Nietzsche is influence in passages from the first edition of We the Living which Rand later revised and in her overall writing style By the time she wrote The Fountainhead Rand had turned against Nietzsche is ideas and the extent of his influence on her even during her early years is disputed\\nRand considered her philosophical opposite to be Immanuel Kant whom she referred to as the most evil man in mankinds history she believed his epistemology undermined reason and his ethics opposed selfinterest Philosophers George Walsh and Fred Seddon have argued she misinterpreted Kant and exaggerated their differences She was also critical of Plato and viewed his differences with Aristotle on questions of metaphysics and epistemology as the primary conflict in the history of philosophy\\nRands relationship with contemporary philosophers was mostly antagonistic She was not an academic and did not participate in academic discourse She was dismissive toward critics and wrote about ideas she disagreed with in a polemical manner without indepth analysis She was in turn viewed very negatively by many academic philosophers who dismissed her as an unimportant figure who need not be given serious consideration\\nReception and legacy\\nCritical reception\\nThe first reviews Rand received were for Night of January 16th Reviews of the Broadway production were largely positive but Rand considered even positive reviews to be embarrassing bececause of significant changes made to her script by the producer Although Rand believed that her novel We the Living was not widely reviewed over 200 publications published approximately 125 different reviews Overall they were more positive than those she received for her later work Her novella Anthem received little review attention both for its first publication in England and for subsequent reissues\\nRands first bestseller The Fountainhead received far fewer reviews than We the Living and reviewers opinions were mixed Lorine Pruettes positive review in The New York Times which called the author a writer of great power who wrote brilliantly beautifully and bitterly was one that Rand greatly appreciated There were other positive reviews but Rand dismissed most of them for either misunderstanding her message or for being in unimportant publications Some negative reviews said the novel was too long others called the characters unsympathetic and Rands style offensively pedestrian\\nAtlas Shrugged was widely reviewed and many of the reviews were strongly negative Atlas Shrugged received positive reviews from a few publications but Rand scholar Mimi Reisel Gladstein later wrote that reviewers seemed to vie with each other in a contest to devise the cleverest putdowns with reviews including comments that it was written out of hate and showed remorseless hectoring and prolixity Whittaker Chambers wrote what was later called the novels most notorious review for the conservative magazine National Review He accused Rand of supporting a godless system which he related to that of the Soviets claiming From almost any page of Atlas Shrugged a voice can be heard  commanding To a gas chamber—go\\nRands nonfiction received far fewer reviews than her novels The tenor of the criticism for her first nonfiction book For the New Intellectual was similar to that for Atlas Shrugged Philosopher Sidney Hook likened her certainty to the way philosophy is written in the Soviet Union and author Gore Vidal called her viewpoint nearly perfect in its immorality These reviews set the pattern for reaction to her ideas among liberal critics Her subsequent books got progressively less review attention\\nPopular interest\\nWith over 30\\xa0million copies sold  Rands books continue to be read widely A survey conducted for the Library of Congress and the BookoftheMonth Club in 1991 asked club members to name the most influential book in their lives Rands Atlas Shrugged was the second most popular choice after the Bible Although Rands influence has been greatest in the United States there has been international interest in her work\\nRands contemporary admirers included fellow novelists like Ira Levin Kay Nolte Smith and L Neil Smith she has influenced later writers like Erika Holzer Terry Goodkind and comic book artist Steve Ditko Rand provided a positive view of business and subsequently many business executives and entrepreneurs have admired and promoted her work Businessmen such as John Allison of BBT and Ed Snider of Comcast Spectacor have funded the promotion of Rands ideas\\nTelevision shows movies and video games have referred to Rand and her works Throughout her life she was the subject of many articles in popular magazines as well as booklength critiques by authors such as the psychologist Albert Ellis and Trinity Foundation president John W Robbins Rand or characters based on her figure prominently in novels by American authors including Mary Gaitskill Matt Ruff Kay Nolte Smith and Tobias Wolff Nick Gillespie former editorinchief of Reason remarked that Rands is a tortured immortality one in which she is as likely to be a punch line as a protagonist Jibes at Rand as cold and inhuman run through the popular culture Two movies have been made about Rands life A 1997 documentary film  was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature The Passion of Ayn Rand a 1999 television adaptation of the book of the same name won several awards Rands image also appears on a 1999 US postage stamp illustrated by artist Nick Gaetano\\nRands works most commonly Anthem or The Fountainhead are sometimes assigned as secondary school reading Since 2002 the Ayn Rand Institute has provided free copies of Rands novels to teachers who promise to include the books in their curriculum The Institute had distributed 45\\xa0million copies in the US and Canada by the end of 2020 In 2017 Rand was added to the required reading list for the A Level Politics exam in the United Kingdom\\nPolitical influence\\nAlthough she rejected the labels conservative and libertarian Rand has had a continuing influence on rightwing politics and libertarianism Rand is often considered one of the three most important women along with Rose Wilder Lane and Isabel Paterson in the early development of modern American libertarianism David Nolan one founder of the Libertarian Party said that without Ayn Rand the libertarian movement would not exist In his history of that movement journalist Brian Doherty described her as the most influential libertarian of the twentieth century to the public at large Historian Jennifer Burns referred to her as the ultimate gateway drug to life on the right\\nThe political figures who cite Rand as an influence are usually conservatives often members of the Republican Party despite Rand taking some atypical positions for a conservative like being prochoice and an atheist She faced intense opposition from William F Buckley Jr and other contributors to the conservative National Review magazine which published numerous criticisms of her writings and ideas Nevertheless a 1987 article in The New York Times referred to her as the Reagan administrations novelist laureate Republican congressmen and conservative pundits have acknowledged her influence on their lives and have recommended her novels She has influenced some conservative politicians outside the US such as Sajid Javid in the United Kingdom Siv Jensen in Norway and Ayelet Shaked in Israel\\nThe financial crisis of 2007–2008 spurred renewed interest in her works especially Atlas Shrugged which some saw as foreshadowing the crisis Opinion articles compared realworld events with the novels plot Signs mentioning Rand and her fictional hero John Galt appeared at Tea Party protests There was increased criticism of her ideas especially from the political left Critics blamed the economic crisis on her support of selfishness and free markets particularly through her influence on Alan Greenspan In 2015 Adam Weiner said that through Greenspan Rand had effectively chucked a ticking time bomb into the boiler room of the US economy Lisa Duggan said that Rands novels had incalculable impact in encouraging the spread of neoliberal political ideas In 2021 Cass Sunstein said Rands ideas could be seen in the tax and regulatory policies of the Trump administration which he attributed to the enduring influence of Rands fiction\\nAcademic reaction\\nDuring Rands lifetime her work received little attention from academic scholars Since her death interest in her work has increased gradually In 2009 historian Jennifer Burns identified three overlapping waves of scholarly interest in Rand including an explosion of scholarship since 2000 As of that year few universities included Rand or Objectivism as a philosophical specialty or research area with many literature and philosophy departments dismissing her as a pop culture phenomenon rather than a subject for serious study From 2002 to 2012 over 60 colleges and universities accepted grants from the charitable foundation of BBT Corporation that required teaching Rands ideas or works in some cases the grants were controversial or even rejected bececause of the requirement to teach about Rand In 2020 media critic Eric Burns said that Rand is surely the most engaging philosopher of my lifetime but nobody in the academe pays any attention to her neither as an author nor a philosopher That same year the editor of a collection of critical essays about Rand said academics who disapproved of her ideas had long held a stubborn resolve to ignore or ridicule her work but he believed more academic critics were engaging with her work in recent years\\nTo her ideas\\nIn 1967 John Hospers discussed Rands ethical ideas in the second edition of his textbook An Introduction to Philosophical Analysis That same year Hazel Barnes included a chapter critiquing Objectivism in her book An Existentialist Ethics When the first fulllength academic book about Rands philosophy appeared in 1971 its author declared writing about Rand a treacherous undertaking that could lead to guilt by association for taking her seriously A few articles about Rands ideas appeared in academic journals before her death in 1982 many of them in The Personalist One of these was On the Randian Argument by libertarian philosopher Robert Nozick who criticized her metaethical arguments Other philosophers writing in the same publication argued that Nozick misstated Rands case In an article responding to Nozick Douglas Den Uyl and Douglas B Rasmussen defended her positions but described her style as literary hyperbolic and emotional\\nThe Philosophic Thought of Ayn Rand a 1984 collection of essays about Objectivism edited by Den Uyl and Rasmussen was the first academic book about Rands ideas published after her death In one essay political writer Jack Wheeler wrote that despite the incessant bombast and continuous venting of Randian rage Rands ethics are a most immense achievement the study of which is vastly more fruitful than any other in contemporary thought In 1987 the Ayn Rand Society was founded as an affiliate of the American Philosophical Association\\nIn a 1995 entry about Rand in Contemporary Women Philosophers Jenny A Heyl described a divergence in how different academic specialties viewed Rand She said that Rands philosophy is regularly omitted from academic philosophy Yet throughout literary academia Ayn Rand is considered a philosopher Writing in the 1998 edition of the Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy political theorist Chandran Kukathas summarized the mainstream philosophical reception of her work in two parts He said most commentators view her ethical argument as an unconvincing variant of Aristotles ethics and her political theory is of little interest bececause it is marred by an illthought out and unsystematic effort to reconcile her hostility to the state with her rejection of anarchism The Journal of Ayn Rand Studies a multidisciplinary peerreviewed academic journal devoted to the study of Rand and her ideas was established in 1999\\nIn a 2010 essay for the Cato Institute Huemer argued very few people find Rands ideas convincing especially her ethics He attributed the attention she receives to her being a compelling writer especially as a novelist noting that Atlas Shrugged outsells Rands nonfiction works and the works of other philosophers of classical liberalism In 2012 the Pennsylvania State University Press agreed to take over publication of The Journal of Ayn Rand Studies and the University of Pittsburgh Press launched an Ayn Rand Society Philosophical Studies series based on the Societys proceedings The Fall 2012 update to the entry about Rand in the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy said that only a few professional philosophers have taken her work seriously That same year political scientist Alan Wolfe dismissed Rand as a nonperson among academics an attitude that writer Ben Murnane later described as the traditional academic view of Rand\\nTo her fiction\\nAcademic consideration of Rand as a literary figure during her life was even more limited than the discussion of her philosophy Mimi Reisel Gladstein could not find any scholarly articles about Rands novels when she began researching her in 1973 and only three such articles appeared during the rest of the 1970s Since her death scholars of English and American literature have continued largely to ignore her work although attention to her literary work has increased since the 1990s Several academic book series about important authors cover Rand and her works as do popular study guides like CliffsNotes and SparkNotes In The Literary Encyclopedia entry for Rand written in 2001 John David Lewis declared that Rand wrote the most intellectually challenging fiction of her generation In 2019 Duggan described Rands fiction as popular and influential on many readers despite being easy to criticize for her cartoonish characters and melodramatic plots her rigid moralizing her middle to lowbrow aesthetic preferences\\xa0 and philosophical strivings\\nObjectivist movement\\nAfter the closure of the Nathaniel Branden Institute the Objectivist movement continued in other forms In the 1970s Peikoff began delivering courses on Objectivism In 1979 Peter Schwartz started a newsletter called The Intellectual Activist which Rand endorsed She also endorsed The Objectivist Forum a bimonthly magazine founded by Objectivist philosopher Harry Binswanger which ran from 1980 to 1987\\nIn 1985 Peikoff worked with businessman Ed Snider to establish the Ayn Rand Institute a nonprofit organization dedicated to promoting Rands ideas and works In 1990 after an ideological disagreement with Peikoff David Kelley founded the Institute for Objectivist Studies now known as The Atlas Society In 2001 historian John McCaskey organized the Anthem Foundation for Objectivist Scholarship which provides grants for scholarly work on Objectivism in academia\\nSelected works\\nFiction and drama\\nNonfiction'"

       "'In Greek mythology Achilles   or Achilleus  was a hero of the Trojan War the greatest of all the Greek warriors and the central character of Homers Iliad He was the son of the Nereid Thetis and Peleus king of Phthia\\nAchilles most notable feat during the Trojan War was the slaying of the Trojan prince Hector outside the gates of Troy Although the death of Achilles is not presented in the Iliad other sources concur that he was killed near the end of the Trojan War by Paris who shot him with an arrow Later legends beginning with Statius unfinished epic Achilleid written in the 1st century AD state that Achilles was invulnerable in all of his body except for one heel bececause when his mother Thetis dipped him in the river Styx as an infant she held him by one of his heels Alluding to these legends the term Achilles heel has come to mean a point of weakness especially in someone or something with an otherwise strong constitution The Achilles tendon is also named after him due to these legends\\nEtymology\\nLinear B tablets attest to the personal name Achilleus in the forms akireu and akirewe the latter being the dative of the former The name grew more popular even becoming common soon after the seventh century BC and was also turned into the female form Ἀχιλλεία Achilleía attested in Attica in the fourth century BC IG II² 1617 and in the form Achillia on a stele in Halicarnassus as the name of a female gladiator fighting an Amazon\\nAchilles name can be analyzed as a combination of  distress pain sorrow grief and  people soldiers nation resulting in a protoform Akhílāu̯os he who has the people distressed or he whose people have distress The grief or distress of the people is a theme raised numerous times in the Iliad and frequently by Achilles himself Achilles role as the hero of grief or distress forms an ironic juxtaposition with the conventional view of him as the hero of  glory usually in war Furthermore laós has been construed by Gregory Nagy following Leonard Palmer to mean a corps of soldiers a muster With this derivation the name obtains a double meaning in the poem when the hero is functioning rightly his men bring distress to the enemy but when wrongly his men get the grief of war The poem is in part about the misdirection of anger on the part of leadership\\nSome researchers deem the name a loan word possibly from a PreGreek language Achilles descent from the Nereid Thetis and a similarity of his name with those of river deities such as Acheron and Achelous have led to speculations about his being an old water divinity see below Worship Robert S P Beekes has suggested a PreGreek origin of the name based among other things on the coexistence of λλ and λ in epic language which may account for a palatalized phoneme ly in the original language\\nBirth and early years\\nAchilles was the son of the Thetis a nereid and Peleus the king of the Myrmidons Zeus and Poseidon had been rivals for Thetiss hand in marriage until Prometheus the forethinker warned Zeus of a prophecy originally uttered by Themis goddess of divine law that Thetis would bear a son greater than his father For this reason the two gods withdrew their pursuit and had her wed Peleus\\nThere is a tale which offers an alternative version of these events In the Argonautica 4760 Zeus sister and wife Hera alludes to Thetis chaste resistance to the advances of Zeus pointing out that Thetis was so loyal to Heras marriage bond that she coolly rejected the father of gods Thetis although a daughter of the seagod Nereus was also brought up by Hera further explaining her resistance to the advances of Zeus Zeus was furious and decreed that she would never marry an immortal\\nAccording to the Achilleid written by Statius in the 1st century AD and to nonsurviving previous sources when Achilles was born Thetis tried to make him immortal by dipping him in the river Styx however he was left vulnerable at the part of the body by which she held him his left heel see Achilles heel Achilles tendon It is not clear if this version of events was known earlier In another version of this story Thetis anointed the boy in ambrosia and put him on top of a fire in order to burn away the mortal parts of his body She was interrupted by Peleus and abandoned both father and son in a rage\\nNone of the sources before Statius make any reference to this general invulnerability To the contrary in the Iliad Homer mentions Achilles being wounded in Book 21 the Paeonian hero Asteropaeus son of Pelagon challenged Achilles by the river Scamander He was ambidextrous and cast a spear from each hand one grazed Achilles elbow drawing a spurt of blood\\nIn the few fragmentary poems of the Epic Cycle which describe the heros death ie the Cypria the Little Iliad by Lesches of Pyrrha the Aithiopis and Iliou persis by Arctinus of Miletus there is no trace of any reference to his general invulnerability or his famous weakness at the heel In the later vase paintings presenting the death of Achilles the arrow or in many cases arrows hit his torso\\nPeleus entrusted Achilles to Chiron the Centaur who lived on Mount Pelion to be reared Thetis foretold that her sons fate was either to gain glory and die young or to live a long but uneventful life in obscurity Achilles chose the former and decided to take part in the Trojan War According to Homer Achilles grew up in Phthia with his companion Patroclus\\nAccording to Photius the sixth book of the New History by Ptolemy Hephaestion reported that Thetis burned in a secret place the children she had by Peleus When she had Achilles Peleus noticed tore him from the flames with only a burnt foot and confided him to the centaur Chiron Later Chiron exhumed the body of the Damysus who was the fastest of all the giants removed the ankle and incorporated it into Achilles burnt foot\\nOther names\\nAmong the appellations under which Achilles is generally known are the following\\nHidden on Skyros\\nSome postHomeric sources claim that in order to keep Achilles safe from the war Thetis or in some versions Peleus hid the young man at the court of Lycomedes king of Skyros\\nThere Achilles was disguised as a girl and lived among Lycomedes daughters perhaps under the name Pyrrha the redhaired girl Cercysera or Aissa swift With Lycomedes daughter Deidamia whom in the account of Statius he raped Achilles there fathered two sons Neoptolemus also called Pyrrhus after his fathers possible alias and Oneiros According to this story Odysseus learned from the prophet Calchas that the Achaeans would be unable to capture Troy without Achilles aid Odysseus went to Skyros in the guise of a peddler selling womens clothes and jewellery and placed a shield and spear among his goods When Achilles instantly took up the spear Odysseus saw through his disguise and convinced him to join the Greek campaign In another version of the story Odysseus arranged for a trumpet alarm to be sounded while he was with Lycomedes women While the women fled in panic Achilles prepared to defend the court thus giving his identity away\\nIn the Trojan War\\nAccording to the Iliad Achilles arrived at Troy with 50 ships each carrying 50 Myrmidons He appointed five leaders each leader commanding 500 Myrmidons Menesthius Eudorus Peisander Phoenix and Alcimedon\\nTelephus\\nWhen the Greeks left for the Trojan War they accidentally stopped in Mysia ruled by King Telephus In the resulting battle Achilles gave Telephus a wound that would not heal Telephus consulted an oracle who stated that he that wounded shall heal Guided by the oracle he arrived at Argos where Achilles healed him in order that he might become their guide for the voyage to Troy\\nAccording to other reports in Euripides lost play about Telephus he went to Aulis pretending to be a beggar and asked Achilles to heal his wound Achilles refused claiming to have no medical knowledge Alternatively Telephus held Orestes for ransom the ransom being Achilles aid in healing the wound Odysseus reasoned that the spear had inflicted the wound therefore the spear must be able to heal it Pieces of the spear were scraped off onto the wound and Telephus was healed\\nTroilus\\nAccording to the Cypria the part of the Epic Cycle that tells the events of the Trojan War before Achilles wrath when the Achaeans desired to return home they were restrained by Achilles who afterwards attacked the cattle of Aeneas sacked neighbouring cities like Pedasus and Lyrnessus where the Greeks capture the queen Briseis and killed Tenes a son of Apollo as well as Priams son Troilus in the sanctuary of Apollo Thymbraios however the romance between Troilus and Chryseis described in Geoffrey Chaucers Troilus and Criseyde and in William Shakespeares Troilus and Cressida is a medieval invention\\nIn Dares Phrygius Account of the Destruction of Troy the Latin summary through which the story of Achilles was transmitted to medieval Europe as well as in older accounts Troilus was a young Trojan prince the youngest of King Priams and Hecubas five legitimate sons or according other sources another son of Apollo Despite his youth he was one of the main Trojan war leaders a horse fighter or chariot fighter according to Homer Prophecies linked Troilus fate to that of Troy and so he was ambushed in an attempt to capture him Yet Achilles struck by the beauty of both Troilus and his sister Polyxena and overcome with lust directed his sexual attentions on the youth\\xa0– who refusing to yield instead found himself decapitated upon an altaromphalos of Apollo Thymbraios Later versions of the story suggested Troilus was accidentally killed by Achilles in an overardent lovers embrace In this version of the myth Achilles death therefore came in retribution for this sacrilege Ancient writers treated Troilus as the epitome of a dead child mourned by his parents Had Troilus lived to adulthood the First Vatican Mythographer claimed Troy would have been invincible however the motif is older and found already in Plautus Bacchides\\nIn the Iliad\\nHomers Iliad is the most famous narrative of Achilles deeds in the Trojan War Achilles wrath μῆνις Ἀχιλλέως mênis Achilléōs is the central theme of the poem The first two lines of the Iliad read\\nThe Homeric epic only covers a few weeks of the decadelong war and does not narrate Achilles death It begins with Achilles withdrawal from battle after being dishonoured by Agamemnon the commander of the Achaean forces Agamemnon has taken a woman named Chryseis as his slave Her father Chryses a priest of Apollo begs Agamemnon to return her to him Agamemnon refuses and Apollo sends a plague amongst the Greeks The prophet Calchas correctly determines the source of the troubles but will not speak unless Achilles vows to protect him Achilles does so and Calchas declares that Chryseis must be returned to her father Agamemnon consents but then commands that Achilles battle prize Briseis the daughter of Briseus be brought to him to replace Chryseis Angry at the dishonour of having his plunder and glory taken away and as he says later bececause he loves Briseis with the urging of his mother Thetis Achilles refuses to fight or lead his troops alongside the other Greek forces At the same time burning with rage over Agamemnons theft Achilles prays to Thetis to convince Zeus to help the Trojans gain ground in the war so that he may regain his honour\\nAs the battle turns against the Greeks thanks to the influence of Zeus Nestor declares that the Trojans are winning bececause Agamemnon has angered Achilles and urges the king to appease the warrior Agamemnon agrees and sends Odysseus and two other chieftains Ajax and Phoenix They promise that if Achilles returns to battle Agamemnon will return the captive Briseis and other gifts Achilles rejects all Agamemnon offers him and simply urges the Greeks to sail home as he was planning to do\\nThe Trojans led by Hector subsequently push the Greek army back toward the beaches and assault the Greek ships With the Greek forces on the verge of absolute destruction Patroclus leads the Myrmidons into battle wearing Achilles armour though Achilles remains at his camp Patroclus succeeds in pushing the Trojans back from the beaches but is killed by Hector before he can lead a proper assault on the city of Troy\\nAfter receiving the news of the death of Patroclus from Antilochus the son of Nestor Achilles grieves over his beloved companions death His mother Thetis comes to comfort the distraught Achilles She persuades Hephaestus to make new armour for him in place of the armour that Patroclus had been wearing which was taken by Hector The new armour includes the Shield of Achilles described in great detail in the poem\\nEnraged over the death of Patroclus Achilles ends his refusal to fight and takes the field killing many men in his rage but always seeking out Hector Achilles even engages in battle with the river god Scamander who has become angry that Achilles is choking his waters with all the men he has killed The god tries to drown Achilles but is stopped by Hera and Hephaestus Zeus himself takes note of Achilles rage and sends the gods to restrain him so that he will not go on to sack Troy itself before the time allotted for its destruction seeming to show that the unhindered rage of Achilles can defy fate itself Finally Achilles finds his prey Achilles chases Hector around the wall of Troy three times before Athena in the form of Hectors favorite and dearest brother Deiphobus persuades Hector to stop running and fight Achilles face to face After Hector realizes the trick he knows the battle is inevitable Wanting to go down fighting he charges at Achilles with his only weapon his sword but misses Accepting his fate Hector begs Achilles not to spare his life but to treat his body with respect after killing him Achilles tells Hector it is hopeless to expect that of him declaring that my rage my fury would drive me now to hack your flesh away and eat you raw – such agonies you have cecaused me Achilles then kills Hector and drags his corpse by its heels behind his chariot After having a dream where Patroclus begs Achilles to hold his funeral Achilles hosts a series of funeral games in honour of his companion\\nAt the onset of his duel with Hector Achilles is referred to as the brightest star in the sky which comes on in the autumn Orions dog Sirius a sign of evil During the cremation of Patroclus he is compared to Hesperus the eveningwestern star Venus while the burning of the funeral pyre lasts until Phosphorus the morningeastern star also Venus has set descended\\nWith the assistance of the god Hermes Argeiphontes Hectors father Priam goes to Achilles tent to plead with Achilles for the return of Hectors body so that he can be buried Achilles relents and promises a truce for the duration of the funeral lasting 9 days with a burial on the 10th in the tradition of Niobes offspring The poem ends with a description of Hectors funeral with the doom of Troy and Achilles himself still to come\\nLater epic accounts fighting Penthesilea and Memnon\\nThe Aethiopis 7th century BC and a work named Posthomerica composed by Quintus of Smyrna in the fourth century CE relate further events from the Trojan War When Penthesilea queen of the Amazons and daughter of Ares arrives in Troy Priam hopes that she will defeat Achilles After his temporary truce with Priam Achilles fights and kills the warrior queen only to grieve over her death later At first he was so distracted by her beauty he did not fight as intensely as usual Once he realized that his distraction was endangering his life he refocused and killed her\\nFollowing the death of Patroclus Nestors son Antilochus becomes Achilles closest companion When Memnon son of the Dawn Goddess Eos and king of Ethiopia slays Antilochus Achilles once more obtains revenge on the battlefield killing Memnon Consequently Eos will not let the sun rise until Zeus persuades her The fight between Achilles and Memnon over Antilochus echoes that of Achilles and Hector over Patroclus except that Memnon unlike Hector was also the son of a goddess\\nMany Homeric scholars argued that episode inspired many details in the Iliads description of the death of Patroclus and Achilles reaction to it The episode then formed the basis of the cyclic epic Aethiopis which was composed after the Iliad possibly in the 7th century BC The Aethiopis is now lost except for scattered fragments quoted by later authors\\nAchilles and Patroclus\\nThe exact nature of Achilles relationship with Patroclus has been a subject of dispute in both the classical period and modern times In the Iliad it appears to be the model of a deep and loyal friendship Homer does not suggest that Achilles and his close friend Patroclus had sexual relations Although there is no direct evidence in the text of the Iliad that Achilles and Patroclus were lovers this theory was expressed by some later authors Commentators from classical antiquity to the present have often interpreted the relationship through the lens of their own cultures In 5thcentury BCE Athens the intense bond was often viewed in light of the Greek custom of paiderasteia In Platos Symposium the participants in a dialogue about love assume that Achilles and Patroclus were a couple Phaedrus argues that Achilles was the younger and more beautiful one so he was the beloved and Patroclus was the lover However ancient Greek had no words to distinguish heterosexual and homosexual and it was assumed that a man could both desire handsome young men and have sex with women Many pairs of men throughout history have been compared to Achilles and Patroclus to imply a homosexual relationship\\nDeath\\nThe death of Achilles even if considered solely as it occurred in the oldest sources is a complex one with many different versions In the oldest version the Iliad and as predicted by Hector with his dying breath the heros death was brought about by Paris with an arrow to the heel according to Statius In some versions the god Apollo guided Paris arrow Some retellings also state that Achilles was scaling the gates of Troy and was hit with a poisoned arrow All of these versions deny Paris any sort of valour owing to the common conception that Paris was a coward and not the man his brother Hector was and Achilles remained undefeated on the battlefield\\nAfter death Achilles bones were mingled with those of Patroclus and funeral games were held He was represented in the Aethiopis as living after his death in the island of Leuke at the mouth of the river Danube\\nAnother version of Achilles death is that he fell deeply in love with one of the Trojan princesses Polyxena Achilles asks Priam for Polyxenas hand in marriage Priam is willing bececause it would mean the end of the war and an alliance with the worlds greatest warrior But while Priam is overseeing the private marriage of Polyxena and Achilles Paris who would have to give up Helen if Achilles married his sister hides in the bushes and shoots Achilles with a divine arrow killing him\\nIn the Odyssey Agamemnon informs Achilles of his pompous burial and the erection of his mound at the Hellespont while they are receiving the dead suitors in Hades He claims they built a massive burial mound on the beach of Ilion that could be seen by anyone approaching from the ocean Achilles was cremated and his ashes buried in the same urn as those of Patroclus Paris was later killed by Philoctetes using the enormous bow of Heracles\\nIn Book 11 of Homers Odyssey Odysseus sails to the underworld and converses with the shades One of these is Achilles who when greeted as blessed in life blessed in death responds that he would rather be a slave to the worst of masters than be king of all the dead But Achilles then asks Odysseus of his sons exploits in the Trojan war and when Odysseus tells of Neoptolemus heroic actions Achilles is filled with satisfaction This leaves the reader with an ambiguous understanding of how Achilles felt about the heroic life\\nAccording to some accounts he had married Medea in life so that after both their deaths they were united in the Elysian Fields of Hades\\xa0– as Hera promised Thetis in Apollonius Argonautica 3rd century BC\\nFate of Achilles armour\\nAchilles armour was the object of a feud between Odysseus and Telamonian Ajax Ajax the greater They competed for it by giving speeches on why they were the bravest after Achilles to their Trojan prisoners who after considering both mens presentations decided Odysseus was more deserving of the armour Furious Ajax cursed Odysseus which earned him the ire of Athena who temporarily made Ajax so mad with grief and anguish that he began killing sheep thinking them his comrades After a while when Athena lifted his madness and Ajax realized that he had actually been killing sheep he was so ashamed that he committed suicide Odysseus eventually gave the armour to Neoptolemus the son of Achilles When Odysseus encounters the shade of Ajax much later in the House of Hades Odyssey 11543–566 Ajax is still so angry about the outcome of the competition that he refuses to speak to Odysseus\\nA relic claimed to be Achilles bronzeheaded spear was preserved for centuries in the temple of Athena on the acropolis of Phaselis Lycia a port on the Pamphylian Gulf The city was visited in 333 BCE by Alexander the Great who envisioned himself as the new Achilles and carried the Iliad with him but his court biographers do not mention the spear however it was shown in the time of Pausanias in the 2nd century CE\\nAchilles Ajax and a game of petteia\\nNumerous paintings on pottery have suggested a tale not mentioned in the literary traditions At some point in the war Achilles and Ajax were playing a board game petteia They were absorbed in the game and oblivious to the surrounding battle The Trojans attacked and reached the heroes who were saved only by an intervention of Athena\\nWorship and heroic cult\\nThe tomb of Achilles extant throughout antiquity in Troad was venerated by Thessalians but also by Persian expeditionary forces as well as by Alexander the Great and the Roman emperor Caracalla Achilles cult was also to be found at other places e g on the island of Astypalaea in the Sporades in Sparta which had a sanctuary in Elis and in Achilles homeland Thessaly as well as in the Magna Graecia cities of Tarentum Locri and Croton accounting for an almost Panhellenic cult to the hero\\nThe cult of Achilles is illustrated in the 500 BCE Polyxena sarcophagus which depicts the sacrifice of Polyxena near the tumulus of Achilles Strabo 13132 also suggested that such a cult of Achilles existed in Troad\\nThe spread and intensity of the heros veneration among the Greeks that had settled on the northern coast of the Pontus Euxinus todays Black Sea appears to have been remarkable An archaic cult is attested for the Milesian colony of Olbia as well as for an island in the middle of the Black Sea today identified with Snake Island Ukrainian Зміїний Zmiinyi near Kiliya Ukraine Early dedicatory inscriptions from the Greek colonies on the Black Sea graffiti and inscribed clay disks these possibly being votive offerings from Olbia the area of Berezan Island and the Tauric Chersonese attest the existence of a heroic cult of Achilles from the sixth century BC onwards The cult was still thriving in the third century CE when dedicatory stelae from Olbia refer to an Achilles Pontárchēs Ποντάρχης roughly lord of the Sea or of the Pontus Euxinus who was invoked as a protector of the city of Olbia venerated on par with Olympian gods such as the local Apollo Prostates Hermes Agoraeus or Poseidon\\nPliny the Elder 23–79 AD in his Natural History mentions a port of the Achæi and an island of Achilles famous for the tomb of that man  situated somewhat nearby Olbia and the DnieperBug Estuary furthermore at 125\\xa0Roman miles from this island he places a peninsula which stretches forth in the shape of a sword obliquely called Dromos Achilleos Ἀχιλλέως δρόμος Achilléōs drómos the Racecourse of Achilles and considered the place of the heros exercise or of games instituted by him This last feature of Plinys account is considered to be the iconic spit called today Tendra or Kosa Tendra and Kosa Djarilgatch situated between the mouth of the Dnieper and Karkinit Bay but which is hardly 125\\xa0Roman miles c 185\\xa0km away from the DnieperBug estuary as Pliny states To the Racecourse he gives a length of 80\\xa0miles c\\xa0120\\xa0km whereas the spit measures c\\xa070\\xa0km today\\nIn the following chapter of his book Pliny refers to the same island as Achillea and introduces two further names for it Leuce or Macaron from Greek νῆσος μακαρῶν island of the blest The present day measures he gives at this point seem to account for an identification of Achillea or Leuce with todays Snake Island Plinys contemporary Pomponius Mela c 43 AD tells that Achilles was buried on an island named Achillea situated between the Borysthenes and the Ister adding to the geographical confusion Ruins of a square temple measuring 30 meters to a side possibly that dedicated to Achilles were discovered by Captain Kritzikly  in 1823 on Snake Island A second exploration in 1840 showed that the construction of a lighthouse had destroyed all traces of this temple A fifth century BC blackglazed lekythos inscription found on the island in 1840 reads Glaukos son of Poseidon dedicated me to Achilles lord of Leuke In another inscription from the fifth or fourth century BC a statue is dedicated to Achilles lord of Leuke by a citizen of Olbia while in a further dedication the city of Olbia confirms its continuous maintenance of the islands cult again suggesting its quality as a place of a supraregional hero veneration\\nThe heroic cult dedicated to Achilles on Leuce seems to go back to an account from the lost epic Aethiopis according to which after his untimely death Thetis had snatched her son from the funeral pyre and removed him to a mythical Leúkē Nêsos White Island Already in the fifth century BC Pindar had mentioned a cult of Achilles on a bright island φαεννά νᾶσος phaenná nâsos of the Black Sea while in another of his works Pindar would retell the story of the immortalized Achilles living on a geographically indefinite Island of the Blest together with other heroes such as his father Peleus and Cadmus Well known is the connection of these mythological Fortunate Isles μακαρῶν νῆσοι makárôn nêsoi or the Homeric Elysium with the stream Oceanus which according to Greek mythology surrounds the inhabited world which should have accounted for the identification of the northern strands of the Euxine with it Guy Hedreen has found further evidence for this connection of Achilles with the northern margin of the inhabited world in a poem by Alcaeus speaking of Achilles lord of Scythia and the opposition of North and South as evoked by Achilles fight against the Aethiopian prince Memnon who in his turn would be removed to his homeland by his mother Eos after his death\\nThe Periplus of the Euxine Sea c 130 AD gives the following details\\nThe Greek geographer Dionysius Periegetes who likely lived during the first century CE wrote that the island was called Leuce bececause the wild animals which live there are white It is said that there in Leuce island reside the souls of Achilles and other heroes and that they wander through the uninhabited valleys of this island this is how Jove rewarded the men who had distinguished themselves through their virtues bececause through virtue they had acquired everlasting honour Similarly others relate the islands name to its white cliffs snakes or birds dwelling there Pausanias has been told that the island is covered with forests and full of animals some wild some tame In this island there is also Achilles temple and his statue Leuce had also a reputation as a place of healing Pausanias reports that the Delphic Pythia sent a lord of Croton to be cured of a chest wound Ammianus Marcellinus attributes the healing to waters aquae on the island\\nA number of important commercial port cities of the Greek waters were dedicated to Achilles Herodotus Pliny the Elder and Strabo reported on the existence of a town Achílleion Ἀχίλλειον built by settlers from Mytilene in the sixth century BC close to the heros presumed burial mound in the Troad Later attestations point to an Achílleion in Messenia according to Stephanus Byzantinus and an Achílleios Ἀχίλλειος in Laconia Nicolae Densuşianu recognized a connection to Achilles in the names of Aquileia and of the northern arm of the Danube delta called Chilia presumably from an older Achileii though his conclusion that Leuce had sovereign rights over the Black Sea evokes modern rather than archaic sealaw\\nThe kings of Epirus claimed to be descended from Achilles through his son Neoptolemus Alexander the Great son of the Epirote princess Olympias could therefore also claim this descent and in many ways strove to be like his great ancestor He is said to have visited the tomb of Achilles at Achilleion while passing Troy In AD 216 the Roman Emperor Caracalla while on his way to war against Parthia emulated Alexander by holding games around Achilles tumulus\\nReception during antiquity\\nIn Greek tragedy\\nThe Greek tragedian Aeschylus wrote a trilogy of plays about Achilles given the title Achilleis by modern scholars The tragedies relate the deeds of Achilles during the Trojan War including his defeat of Hector and eventual death when an arrow shot by Paris and guided by Apollo punctures his heel Extant fragments of the Achilleis and other Aeschylean fragments have been assembled to produce a workable modern play The first part of the Achilleis trilogy The Myrmidons focused on the relationship between Achilles and chorus who represent the Achaean army and try to convince Achilles to give up his quarrel with Agamemnon only a few lines survive today In Platos Symposium Phaedrus points out that Aeschylus portrayed Achilles as the lover and Patroclus as the beloved Phaedrus argues that this is incorrect bececause Achilles being the younger and more beautiful of the two was the beloved who loved his lover so much that he chose to die to avenge him\\nThe tragedian Sophocles also wrote The Lovers of Achilles a play with Achilles as the main character Only a few fragments survive\\nTowards the end of the 5th century BCE a more negative view of Achilles emerges in Greek drama Euripides refers to Achilles in a bitter or ironic tone in Hecuba Electra and Iphigenia in Aulis\\nIn Greek philosophy\\nZeno\\nThe philosopher Zeno of Elea centred one of his paradoxes on an imaginary footrace between swiftfooted Achilles and a tortoise by which he attempted to show that Achilles could not catch up to a tortoise with a head start and therefore that motion and change were impossible As a student of the monist Parmenides and a member of the Eleatic school Zeno believed time and motion to be illusions\\nPlato\\nIn Hippias Minor a dialogue attributed to Plato an arrogant man named Hippias argues with Socrates The two get into a discussion about lying They decide that a person who is intentionally false must be better than a person who is unintentionally false on the basis that someone who lies intentionally must understand the subject about which they are lying Socrates uses various analogies discussing athletics and the sciences to prove his point The two also reference Homer extensively Socrates and Hippias agree that Odysseus who concocted a number of lies throughout the Odyssey and other stories in the Trojan War Cycle was false intentionally Achilles like Odysseus told numerous falsehoods Hippias believes that Achilles was a generally honest man while Socrates believes that Achilles lied for his own benefit The two argue over whether it is better to lie on purpose or by accident Socrates eventually abandons Homeric arguments and makes sports analogies to drive home the point someone who does wrong on purpose is a better person than someone who does wrong unintentionally\\nIn Roman and medieval literature\\nThe Romans who traditionally traced their lineage to Troy took a highly negative view of Achilles Virgil refers to Achilles as a savage and a merciless butcher of men while Horace portrays Achilles ruthlessly slaying women and children Other writers such as Catullus Propertius and Ovid represent a second strand of disparagement with an emphasis on Achilles erotic career This strand continues in Latin accounts of the Trojan War by writers such as Dictys Cretensis and Dares Phrygius and in Benoît de SainteMaures Roman de Troie and Guido delle Colonnes Historia destructionis Troiae which remained the most widely read and retold versions of the Matter of Troy until the 17th century\\nAchilles was described by the Byzantine chronicler Leo the Deacon not as Hellene but as Scythian while according to the Byzantine author John Malalas his army was made up of a tribe previously known as Myrmidons and later as Bulgars\\nIn modern literature and arts\\nMusic\\nAchilles has been frequently the subject of operas ballets and related genres\\nFilm and television\\nIn films Achilles has been portrayed in the following films and television series'"
